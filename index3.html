        <h2>Filesystem</h2>
        <p>
            So far in class we've discussed and went over several topics that have gave us as new coders tools for the tool belt of software developing.
            In the file system section of the first week, we learned how to make directiories and then make a file to go inside each folder. This starts most of the projects and gives us a way to maintain all our work.
            We learned how to navigate through the folders using different terms/acronymns (pwd, ls, cd).

    <h3>Git/GitHub</h3>
        <p>
            Git/Github is a place to store repositories which is a another name for tracking worj=k that has been done in the visual studio editor. the Git portion more specificly is the actual in code work that has different terms to support different parts of what we want to happen in the repository, as in ( Step 1,Git init.. initilize a repository, Step 2, Git add.. adds the files you want to be tracked
            Step 3, Git commit...makes the  files committed and you have to add a comment to be read in the actual hub. there is a few other steps that can be done while in this git setting like branch, merge, revert, and so on.  Step 4 is the pushing portion which allows the user to push work to the hub for other coders to see or work on.)
            GitHub is the actual site that is used to watch the work being commited and pushed or pulled. Basically a collection of all the work you been tracking.

    <h4>Python</h4>
        <p>
            Python was our first actual responsive program we learned. It was more user experience based meaning we were taught how to have the program run and ask questions learned if else statements which also was a user input program. We were taught different data types for example, "strings", integers 7359, floats 9879.3, booleans T/F, lists[ "one", 1, "1"] and lastly dictionaries { "Jeremy": 29,}
            We also learned looping which is used to make a block of statements repeat until an actual condition is given and is satisfied.
            We learned how to create a variable which is basically message storing.

    <h5>HTML</h5>
        <p>
            Html was a markup language used to be designed and displayed on the actual web browser. We learned to use it along with cascading style sheets or css. Html is the foundation and structure of the webpage yoour creating. it gives its format and layout of exactly how you want it to look. In html we used different syntax, which are the rules around how something should be typed. we also used eelements, which again are the builduing elements or tag names then the attribute that comes behind it.
